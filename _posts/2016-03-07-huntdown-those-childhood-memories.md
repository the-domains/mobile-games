Once in a while you find an image of an upcoming game for mobile that triggers some sweet childhood memories. Huntdown is one of those games. Huntdown reminds me of playing Double Dragon with friends on the C64\. It reminds me of Target Renegade on my Spectrum. It reminds me of reading Neuromancer by William Gibson. It reminds me of Kung Fury, that other 80's inspired piece of awesomeness that also hails from Sweden.  
It will be out when its ready I expect. Hopefully that's sometime in 2016\.
